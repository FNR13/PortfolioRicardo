# Portfolio - Ricardo  
Repository for storing all my projects  

As of today (**March 14, 2025**), I have not yet completed my master's thesis, as I am still pursuing my degree. However, I am sharing some interesting projects I have worked on so far.  

## ISR Project  
At **ISR**, I worked on the **projection of complementary filters** using the systems presented in `DSOR_meeting_filters`.  
To tune the gains of these filters, the **Kalman technique** was applied. Since some systems exhibited nonlinearities, an **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** was used.  

## SG Control Project  
In **SG Control**, I contributed to the **projection of an MPC controller** for the flight control of the upcoming **TÃ©cnico Solar Boat vessel, SG01**.  

> *These projects were not initially intended to be displayed publicly in this format, so I apologize for any confusion.*  

## Bachelor's Final Project (`PIC_Group_04_BUSY_FinalReport`)
As part of my **bachelor's final project**, I worked on the **design of an autonomous vehicle for a dedicated lane**, as part of an **8-member team**.  

I was primarily responsible for the **control department**. In the control section of the report, you will find details on the **sensors and strategies** used for vehicle automation.  

I acknowledge that the **sensor selection was not ideal**, but due to strict **budget constraints**, priority was given to other components of the vehicle *(such as the structure)*.
