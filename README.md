Repo for storing my projects  

As of **March 14, 2025**, I haven’t completed my master's thesis yet, as I’m still in my course. But here are some interesting projects I’ve worked on so far.

> *These weren’t originally meant to be shared publicly like this, so I apologize for any confusion.*  

## ISR Project  
At **ISR**, I worked on **complementary filter design** using the systems in `DSOR_meeting_filters`.  
To tune the filter gains, I used the **Kalman technique**. Since some systems had nonlinearities, an **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** was applied.  

## SG Control Project  
In **SG Control**, I worked on an **MPC controller** for flight control of the next **Técnico Solar Boat vessel, SG01**.  

## Bachelor's Final Project (`PIC_Group_04_BUSY_FinalReport`)  
For my **bachelor's final project**, I helped design an **autonomous vehicle for a dedicated lane** as part of an **8-member team**.  

I was mainly in charge of **control systems**. There is a section in the report which covers the **sensors and strategies** used for automation.  

I know the **sensor selection wasn’t ideal**, but due to a tight **budget**, we had to prioritize other components *(like the structure)*.
